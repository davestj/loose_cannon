# Loose Cannon

## Introduction

Loose Cannon is your go-to chaos DevSecOps engineering companion for those moments when you need to shake things up in your AWS infrastructure. Named after the slang term for someone unpredictable, this tool lives up to its name by helping you identify and fortify vulnerabilities in your systems, all while injecting a bit of controlled chaos.

## What is  DevSecOps  Chaos Engineering?

Chaos engineering is like stress testing on steroids. It's the practice of deliberately wreaking havoc on your systems to see how they hold up under pressure. By simulating real-world disasters and malicious attacks, chaos engineering helps you build more resilient and secure architectures.

## Why Use Loose Cannon?

### DevSecOps Integration:
Loose Cannon seamlessly integrates into the DevSecOps pipeline, allowing security and operations teams to collaborate in a chaotic yet controlled environment. Together, they can identify, prioritize, and address security vulnerabilities before they spiral out of control.

### Security Posturing:
In the world of cybersecurity, it's not about if an attack will happen, but when. Loose Cannon helps you stay one step ahead by identifying weak spots in your defenses and fortifying your security posture. Think of it as your preemptive strike against cyber threats.

### Resilience Testing:
When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Loose Cannon tests the resilience of your systems by randomly terminating EC2 instances. It's like pushing your infrastructure to its breaking point to see how well it bounces back. Spoiler alert: with Loose Cannon on your side, resilience is the name of the game.

## Getting Started

To unleash chaos with Loose Cannon, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Loose Cannon is Python-powered, so make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**: Ensure your AWS credentials are set up correctly, whether through environment variables or the AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`).

4. **Run Loose Cannon**: Fire up the Loose Cannon script with the desired parameters and watch the chaos unfold (in a controlled manner, of course).

## Usage

Here's a taste of how to use Loose Cannon:

```
python loose_cannon.py --instance-ids <instance-id-1> <instance-id-2> ...
```

Replace `<instance-id-1>`, `<instance-id-2>`, etc., with the IDs of the EC2 instances you want to send to the proverbial plank.
